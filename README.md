# Autogram Autograph
Minimum viable graph data for node projects.

Instantiate a new graph, populate it with nodes and edges. Stick arbitrary properties on your objects, or add subclasses to enforce rules for specific edge and node types. Save the whole thing to a JSON file and reload it — or swap in a beefier persistence mechanism to leverage a database server or Real Graph Database™.
